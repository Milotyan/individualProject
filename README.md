# individualProject
This repository contains all the files enabling functionality of STM32L412KBT6 for the underwater charger.

These files belong to the core directory of the STM32 project. The main.c file is the one that sets all the parameters up, which was discussed in the report. 
The rest of the files are configuring pins and drivers. They were generated automatically after setting the pins up for the respective microcontroller in the Cube IDE.
